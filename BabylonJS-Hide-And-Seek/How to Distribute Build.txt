- Look under "scenes/_assets/fonts" and ensure that the GROBOLD.ttf font file is there
	- add font to the folder if it's missing

- From the babylonjs workspace
	- npm run build
	- from the root level copy "scenes", "dist", and "index.html" to another folder that will be used to upload the build to the server.

- add new "assets" folder at root level with the expected path for UI textures "assets/textures/UI" and move the UI textures to it from "scenes/_assets/textures/UI
	- idea is to move the textures to the location the GUI loader will be looking for them
