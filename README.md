# Hide and Seek Demo

The purpose of this technical demo is to show how to use Colyseus with the Babylon.js Editor. 
The following documentation covers installing and using the Colyseus SDK, as well as locally running a Colyseus server. 
The demo is designed to work with Colyseus version 0.14.20 and Babylon.js Editor version 4.4.0. This demo is called "Hide and Seek" and is a simple game where players are assigned roles at random to either be Hiders (ghosts) or the lone Seeker (pumpkin head). 
In order for the Hiders to win they need to evade the Seeker until time runs out.
